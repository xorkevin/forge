## forge gen

Executes command line directives in source files

### Synopsis

Executes command line directives in source files

Directives appear in the form of:

	PREFIX command args... SUFFIX

forge gen directives end on the first new line or suffix.

Shell execution is driven by sh -c CMD.

By default the files that git ignores and git submodules will be ignored. This
behavior may be changed with -i, --noignore.

A dry run of the commands will be shown with the -n flag.

forge gen provides the follwing environment variables to the executed command:

	FORGEDIR: path of the current working directory
	FORGEPATH: filepath of the file with the forge directive
	FORGEFILE: filename of the file with the forge directive


```
forge gen [path | file glob ...] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -n, --dryrun          do not exec directives but print what would be executed
  -h, --help            help for gen
  -i, --noignore        do not use .gitignore
  -p, --prefix string   set prefix for forge directive (default "+forge:gen")
  -s, --suffix string   set suffix for forge directive (default "+gen:end")
  -v, --verbose         increase the verbosity of the output
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string   config file (default is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.forge.yaml)
```
