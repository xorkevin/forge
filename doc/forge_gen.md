## forge gen

Executes command line directives in source files

### Synopsis

Executes command line directives in source files

Directives appear in the form of:

	<prefix>command args...<suffix>

forge gen directives end on the first new line or suffix.

Shell execution is driven by nutcracker.

By default the files that git ignores and git submodules will be ignored. This
behavior may be changed with -i, --noignore.

A dry run of the commands will be shown with the -n flag.

forge gen provides the follwing environment variables to the executed command:

	FORGEPATH: filepath of the file with the forge directive
	FORGEFILE: filename of the file with the forge directive


```
forge gen [path | file glob ...] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -n, --dryrun          do not exec directives but print what would be executed
  -h, --help            help for gen
  -i, --noignore        do not use .gitignore
  -p, --prefix string   set prefix for forge directive (default "+forge:gen")
  -s, --suffix string   set suffix for forge directive (default "+gen:end")
  -v, --verbose         increase the verbosity of the output
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.forge.yaml)
```
