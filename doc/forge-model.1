.SH NAME
.PP
forge-model - Generates models


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBforge model [query ...] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generates common SQL patterns needed for relational models

.PP
forge model is called with the following environment variables:

.PP
.RS

.nf
GOPACKAGE: name of the go package
GOFILE: name of the go source file

.fi
.RE

.PP
forge model code generates go functions for SQL select, insert, update, and
delete for a model by default, with additional queries provided as arguments.

.PP
The SQL table's columns for a model are specified by the "model" tag on fields
of a Go struct representing a row of the table. A "model" tag's value has the
following syntax:

.PP
.RS

.nf
column_name,sql_type[;opt[,args ...][; ...]]

.fi
.RE

.PP
Fields without a "model" tag are ignored.

.PP
Valid opts are:
	- index: args(field,...), creates a index from the provided fields and
	current field

.PP
A query allows additional common case select statements to be code generated.
It is specified by a "query" tag on a struct representing a row of the query
result with a value of the syntax:

.PP
.RS

.nf
column_name[;flag[,args ...][; ...]]

.fi
.RE

.PP
column_name refers to the column name defined in the model. The go field type
must also be the same between the model and the query.

.PP
Fields without a "query" tag are ignored.

.PP
Valid flags are:
	- getoneeq: args(equal_field,...), gets a single row where the equal field(s)
	are equal to the input
	- getgroup: (no args), gets all rows ordered by the field value
	- getgroupeq: args(equal_field,...), gets all rows where the equal field(s)
	are equal to the input ordered by the field value
	- updeq: args(equal_field,...), updates all rows where the equal fields(s)
	are equal to the input
	- deleq: args(equal_field,...), deletes all rows where the equal fields(s)
	are equal to the input

.PP
equal_field by default has a condition of eq, but it may be explicitly
specified by column_name|cond. cond may be one of:
	- eq: column value equals the input
	- neq: column value not equal to the input
	- lt: column value less than the input
	- leq: column value less than or equal to the input
	- gt: column value greater than the input
	- geq: column value greater than or equal to the input
	- in: column value equals one of the values of the input set
	- like: column value like the input
